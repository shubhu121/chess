## 🎯 Smart Features

### Context-Aware Tips
The tips system analyzes your position and provides relevant advice:

1. **Opening Phase** (moves 1-10)
   - Reminds you to develop pieces
   - Encourages center control
   - Suggests castling when appropriate

2. **Middle Game** (moves 10+)
   - Checks for piece activity
   - Warns about exposed king
   - Suggests tactical opportunities

3. **Special Situations**
   - Check warnings (when you're in check)
   - Check notifications (when you give check)
   - General principles when no specific issues found

### Move Hints
The hint system evaluates moves based on:
- Captures (highest priority)
- Checks (tactical opportunities)
- Center control (strategic value)
- Safe, developing moves

### User Progression
Track your improvement over time:
- Games won/lost/drawn
- Win rate calculation
- Rating system (future: adjust based on performance)
- Personal game library
